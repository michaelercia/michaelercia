I’m a cybersecurity student working toward a career as a SOC Analyst. I enjoy learning about threat detection, vulnerability analysis, and how real-world attacks happen. This GitHub is where I share labs, notes, and projects from my coursework, certifications, and hands-on practice as I continue building practical security skills.

## Objective

To build and showcase hands-on cybersecurity skills through labs, projects, and continuous learning, with the goal of becoming a SOC Analyst and contributing to real-world threat detection and incident response.
